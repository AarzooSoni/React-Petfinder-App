# 🐶🐱 Pet Finder React App Tutorial

Welcome to the **Pet Finder React App** repository! This project is designed to learn the intricacies of React by building a comprehensive pet adoption website.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get the app up and running on your local machine, follow these instructions:

### Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have **Node.js** installed on your system. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### 🛠 Dependencies

This project relies on several key dependencies:

- **json-server**: Used to mock a REST API for our application.
- **concurrently**: Allows us to run multiple commands simultaneously.
- **react-router-dom**: Enables routing capabilities within our React app.
- **axios**: A popular promise-based HTTP client for making asynchronous requests.

To install these dependencies, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install json-server concurrently react-router-dom axios
```
